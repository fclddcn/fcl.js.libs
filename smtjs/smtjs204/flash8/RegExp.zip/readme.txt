This class is provided for flash community for free with a kind request 
to keep the copyright lines in AS file untouched. However, debugging and 
development of class takes much time limiting my opportunities to earn 
some income on other projects. To overcome this, I have set up an account 
with PayPal (http://www.paypal.com). Please, if you find my work valuable,
especially if you use it in commercial projects, make a donation 
to pavils@mailbox.riga.lv of amount you feel is right. Please provide your
E-mail address upon payment submission so I can enlist you in my upgrade newslist.
